#Welcome to Ghetto Hidden's official Repo.#
For those of you that are new to Ghetto Hidden, I will explain what it is.
Ghetto Hidden is a project that is based on an idea Boris from (http://fadw.net "From A Different World") inside the Trouble in Terrorist Town gamemode.
The idea game from the mod Hidden: Source. We had "Hidden", that were the Traitors at the time. Then there were Hunters, also known as detectives.
From that, it evolved into Alex (Decicus) to use the idea to modify the TTT gamemode to become Ghetto Hidden. As a Lua coder that is still learning the language, it has gone quite well so far.
